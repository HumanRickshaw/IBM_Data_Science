    "Traffic accidents are a common occurence of our daily life, commuting to and from work, the grocery store, and gym.  They can be in a rural or urban location.  They can affect pedestrians, bicyclists, commuters, public transportation, and truck drivers.\n",
    "They occur throughout the year in all weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812013):\n",

    "<p style = \"margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;\">In 2010, there were 32,999 people killed, 3.9 million were injured, and 24 million vehicles were damaged in motor vehicle crashes in the United States. The economic costs of these crashes totaled $\\$$242 billion. Included in these losses are lost productivity, medical costs, legal and court costs, emergency service costs (EMS), insurance administration costs, congestion costs, property damage, and workplace losses. The $\\$242$ billion cost of motor vehicle crashes represents the equivalent of nearly $\\$784$ for each of the 308.7 million people living in the United States, and 1.6 percent of the $\\$14.96$ trillion real U.S. Gross Domestic Product for 2010.</p>\n",

    "According to the [Association for Safe International Road Travel](https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/#:~:text=More%20than%2038%2C000%20people%20die,for%20people%20aged%201%2D54):\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>More than 38,000 people die every year in crashes on U.S. roadways. The U.S. traffic fatality rate is 12.4 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants.</li>\n",
    "    <li>An additional 4.4 million are injured seriously enough to require medical attention.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Road crashes are the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people aged 1-54.</li>\n",

    "</ul>    \n",
    "\n",
    "In American slang, we even have a term, *rubbernecking*, that causes traffic to slow down because drivers are distracted by and want to look an accident. [A 2001 study](https://file.scirp.org/pdf/JTTs_2014012613374086.pdf) found that rubbernecking because of vehicle crashes accounted for 16% of all vehicle crashes, and rubbernecking from all causes accounted for 35%.\n",

    "The dataset provided is a collaborative effort by Seattle Police Depart and Seattle Department of Transportation.  It has approximately 195,000 collisions of various types from Jan 2004 - May 2020.\n",

    "Predicting the severity of these accidents would be beneficial to allocate emergency response teams more efficiently at particular locations and specific times.\n",

    "# II. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict accident severity, I eliminated variables that are not result of the collision. I kept variables related to the setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are location (latitude/longitude and address type), date and time, light conditions, road conditions, and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing NAs and Unknowns, approximately 24.8% of the 194,673 collisions were removed.  146,355 collisions remained for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# III. Density of Collisions by Neighborhood\n",
    "\n",
    "The data originally had latitude and longitude to document the locaton of the collision. 5,334 collisions had no coordinate data, so a little less than 190,000 observations were used in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to determine the neighborhoods from the coordinates.  To do so, I accessed the [neighborhood boundaries of Seattle](https://github.com/seattleio/seattle-boundaries-data/blob/master/data/neighborhoods.geojson).  Using the shapely package, I was able to loop collision locations through neighborhood shapes and return a boolean.  Approximately 5% of the collisions were documented as being on a boundary, so I checked east, south, west, and north of the accident in increments until I received an exact match.\n",
    "\n",
    "94 of Seattle's 175 neighborhoods had a documented collision from Jan 2004 - May 2020.  Belltown and Industrial District had the most with well over 8,500 each and West Hill had only 20.\n",

    "\n",
    "There seems to be slightly more accidents from 2005-2008 and slightly less from 2011-2013, but overall the variance seems to be within reason.\n",

    "While there are definitely more accidents on Friday (perhaps stressed from the work week, perhaps more traveling for longer periods for the weekend) and fewer on Sunday (perhaps more relax at home), the ratio of Property Damage to Injury by day reflects the overall ratio of 2:1.\n",

    "<img src = \"IV.4.Time.png\" width = \"900\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that is far from true!  It is clear that the majority of accidents happen in the business, lunch, and daylight hours of 8:00 - 18:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "There seems to be a disproportionate number of accidents reported on, in decreasing order:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Every hour, particularly between 12:00 - 18:00.</li>\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there was a disproportionate spike at 00:01:00, which means accidents being purposely documented to the the next day was not uncommon.  I found this extremely fascinating, perhaps for beauracratic reasons, quotas, night shift, etc.  Upon further investigation, I learned these times did not coincide with specific dates, ie 1st of a month.

    "# VI. Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Four models, using two different location measures, were evaluated on the training set and test set.  Note that all 16 results are within 67.1-67.3%.  I could not immediately see a significance in the difference between Latitude/Longitude or the Neighborhoods.  Neighborhoods did take longer to run in general, as about 90 dummy variables were added to categorize all neighborhoods with non-zero accident counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Neighborhood as the location predictor, K-Nearest Neighbors at 500 Neighbors and a Linear Support Vector Classifier applying a L2 penalty yielded 67.27% and 67.26% accuracy.  The SVM took less than 30 seconds, whereas the KNN took several hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Property Damage and Injury occur approximately $\\dfrac{2}{3}$ and $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ of the time, randomly classifying Property Damage $\\dfrac{2}{3}$ the time and Injury $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ the time would yield an accuracy of $\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\right)^2+ \\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\dfrac{5}{9} \\approx 55.6\\%$.  The learned model seemed to be a significant improvement from that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## K-Nearest Neighbor (N = 500, *Neighborhood* as location)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"VI.KNN.png\" width = \"500\">\n",

    "## Linear Suport Vector Classifier ($C = 10^{-3}$, *Neighborhood* as location)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"VI.LSVC.png\" width = \"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "My best algorithms are ~67% accurate because they are classifying accidents as Property Damage ~99% of the time, and ~67% of accidents happen to be Property Damage!\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictors I used were immediate predictors related to the scene and setting of an accident.  Some other predictors, perhaps, number of cars, pedestrians, speeding, under the influence, etc., could possibly be useful and improve accuracy, but require more time to gather details.  In addition, if one were at the scene of the accident gathering those variables, one could easily determine if there were Property Damage or Injury. Prediction then becomes unnecessary because one can simply document the result at the scene.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis suggests that accidents in general should be predicted as \"Property Damage\" twice as often as \"Injury\".  The variable distributions across Date/Day/Time and Light/Road/Weather Conditions strongly support this notion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable interaction could possibly make a difference.  Due to the consistency of the 2:1 ratio among labels within variables, as well as computing power limitations, I decided not to explore this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset did not specify collisionss which had both property damage and injury.  It would be interesting to see how many would be labeled as such, and if any variables are correlated with it."
